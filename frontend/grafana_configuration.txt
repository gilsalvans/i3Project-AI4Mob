Grafana's Docker image must first be pulled by using the following command:

docker pull grafana/grafana

Once it is saved on the server, it is time to run a Grafana container from this image. In this container, we must 
specify what plugins must be installed. These plugins are extra funcionalities from Grafana's developers community.
To make the dashboard accessible by the public, a configuration variable enabling the anonymous login has to be 
pointed. Obviously, the anonymous users have only viewer privileges.
To finish the setup of Grafana on the server, the following command is run:

docker run -d  -p 3001:3000  
--name=grafana 
-e "GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS=grafana-clock-panel,grafana-simple-json-datasource, grafana-worldmap-panel"
-e "GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=true"
 grafana/grafana


After this, all the dashboard development and DB connection can be done through the Grafana web interface that I just set up
by using these aforementioned commands.


NOTE: these commands are run on the command line, while being connected to the server (via SSH).
