In this folder there is a sample of the used data for this research. As stated in the documentation, most of the used data is
private (from the Salzburger Verkehrsverbund). Therefore, a data subset of the bus measurements data (svv_bus_data_SUBSET)
and a subset of the stations geometries (stops_geoms_SUBSET) have been exported on a CSV for the user to get a rough idea.

The third and the fourth datasets (sbg_districts and precipitation), are from open sources. Therefore,
both are entirely uploaded. For the districts, the uploaded csv contains the already clipped districts for the
province of Salzburg.
